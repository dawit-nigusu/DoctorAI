End to End Medical chatbot built using Open AI LLM and LangChain

# Description
The "End-to-End Medical Chatbot Project" aims to build a sophisticated conversational AI for the healthcare domain, utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated with Pinecone and LangChain. 

The chatbot will provide accurate responses to health-related queries, assist in medical guidance, and retrieve relevant medical data using Pinecone's vector database for efficient and scalable search. 

The project involves setting up a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, configuring conversational flows, ensuring compliance with health information privacy standards, and validating outputs for medical accuracy. 

This project is ideal for creating intelligent virtual assistants for patient support, telemedicine, or healthcare research.
